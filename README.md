[*This repository contains the sources for my post about hacking X Rebirth for fun and education* ](http://fabian.trampusch.info/blog/hacking-xrebirth-for-fun-and-education/)

It contains three sub projects.  
***dll-project*** contains the debug print function, which will be injected in X Rebirth.  
***files-for-cheatengine*** contains the Auto Assemble sources. You can open them in Cheat Engine.
***web-app*** contains a little node-js based web site which uses websockets to notify listener for updates to your credits by reading the file of the dll.
